        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Imagine a game that changes based on how you play it. A game that tells a story in which everything that happens makes perfect sense because of what you've done. The events in the story are not predetermined; they evolve as you travel back and forth in time in order to alter the ultimate course of events. You have free reign to change what has happened by interacting with characters that have motivations and behaviors inspired by classic <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie'>Agatha Christie</a> mystery fiction &ndash; the kind of fiction that features guests trapped in a mansion, having sordid affairs, and murdering one another over petty squabbles.</p>
        <p>You play as a time traveler thrust into this mess, gradually discovering how to shape events so that they end in your favor. Maybe you decide to play the hero, saving lives by preventing characters from meeting under unfortunate circumstances. Perhaps you thrive on chaos and want to see if you can make all of the mansion's inhabitants attack one another.</p>
        <p>It's all up to you.</p>
        <p><span class='ref game-name'>Time mansion</span> is a point-and-click puzzle adventure game that puts you in control of the story. No longer is the outcome a linear slog through pre-scripted sequence designed by writers hundreds of miles away. Instead, each short playthrough is unique and won't have been experienced before by you or anyone else in the world.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, most games have primarily linear narratives that fail to change based on what players do within the game.<sup class='sidenote-marker' data='ref-required-linearity'>&#8251;</sup> Linear stories are better suited to media like film and literature, since the distinguishing characteristic of games is <em>interactivity</em>. Some games, like <span class='ref'>Quicksilver: Infinite Story</span>, feature a dynamic story generation system to make stories in games more interactive:</p>

        <p><span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> combines the video game as a "box of possibilities"<sup class='sidenote-marker' data='ref-frankenstein-monster'>&#8251;</sup> style of storytelling with the context of a dynamic story system. It allows you, as the player, to explore long-term consequence chains and empowers you to create a time travel meta-narrative more compelling than a dynamic story system could ever create on its own.</p>

        <h2 id='gameplay'>Gameplay</h2>
        <p><span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> is a mechanically simple game that plays like a first person adventure in the style of <a class='ref' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst'>Myst</a>. The mechanics consist of</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Moving from room to room</li>
          <li>Interacting with characters</li>
          <li>Going back in time</li>
        </ul>
        <div class='subsection'>
          <h3 id='mechanics'>Mechanics</h3>
          <p><strong id='movement' class='key-term'>Movement</strong> in <span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> must be extremely simple and intuitive. The core of the game is uncovering and manipulating &ndash; there is no place for first-person-shooter style movement controls. You will be able to see one room at a time, from one perspective. Tapping on one of the doors will instantly transport you to the next room. You will be able to envision yourself however you choose since you will not have a visible avatar. At the same time, you won't experience the classic adventure game disconnect of waiting for your avatar to catch up to your actions.</p>
          <p><strong id='interacting' class='key-term'>Interacting</strong> is the least specified aspect of the game and will need to be playtested thoroughly. A potential player-character interaction that may be successful is temporarily taking control of a computer-controlled character in order to make it behave uncharacteristically. This could be used to delay characters moving to other rooms in the mansion or to manipulate the emotional state and relationships of other characters.</p>
          <p><strong id='time-travel' class='key-term'>Time travel</strong> will likely consist of clicking a single button to jump back to the beginning of the story. For the sake of simplicity and player experimentation, actions in other timelines will be erased as if they never happened. If this form of time travel proves too frustrating to players because of lost progress, it may be necessary to introduce a reverse time slider as an alternative to a single button.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='subsection'>
          <h3 id='end-conditions'>End Conditions</h3>
          <p>A session of <span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> will end when all of the characters are dead or when it becomes time for the guests to leave. This artificial time limit will be chosen to ensure that the story being told remains compelling. At the same time, it enables player-driven goals such as "keep all the guests alive until the party ends."</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id='storytelling-and-ai'>Storytelling and AI</h2>
        <p><span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span>'s unique approach to storytelling ensures that every action you take as a player directly affects the story. Something as simple as delaying a character from leaving a room can have far-reaching consequences in the life, death, and relationships of other guests in the game.</p>
        <p>Because of the time travel mechanic, the story needs to be completely deterministic: unless you intervene, a given story should always have the same outcome no matter how often you travel back in time. Without this property, you will come to suspect that your actions are meaningless.<sup class='sidenote-marker' data='ref-meaningful-actions'>&#8251;</sup><span class='sidenote'><span class='note'><span id='ref-meaningful-actions' class='sidenote-marker-ref'>&#8251;</span><span class='quote'>Elegant rules allow players to focus on the experience of play rather than on the logic of the rules. Designing meaningful play involves building discernible and integrated relationships between action and outcome into all levels of the rules of a game.</span>- <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Rules-Play-Game-Design-Fundamentals-ebook/dp/B007GCCAQW/'>Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals</a> pg 139</span></span> In order for a game to be fun to play, it needs to empower the player.</p>
        <p>The heart of <span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> is the <strong class='key-term'>story simulator</strong>: a system that determines the behavior of a set of characters with initial relationships, personalities, emotions, and locations within a world over time.</p>
        <p>I've created a prototype of the story simulator for you to try out (try clicking the "New Story" button):</p>
        <div class='demo js-game' id='story-simulator'>

        </div>
        <div class='subsection'>
          <h3 id='simulating-interactions'>Simulating Interactions</h3>
          <p>Characters in <span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> have fixed <strong class='key-term'>traits</strong> and fluid <strong class='key-term'>states</strong> that define their behavior.</p>
          <p>In the simplest form of simulation, the traits simply specify their gender preferences for amorous relationships:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>is</strong> (gender)</li>
            <li><strong>attracted to</strong> (gender(s))</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Character states are more complex, including</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>alive?</strong> (true or false)</li>
            <li><strong>location</strong> (a room in the mansion)</li>
            <li><strong>path</strong> (a list of intended destinations)</li>
            <li><strong>emotion</strong> (happy, angry, sad, or guilty)</li>
            <li><strong>relationships</strong> (a set of connections with every other character specifying if they are friends, foes, or lovers)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When one character meets another, their states change based on their traits and their current states. This change is classified as an <strong class='key-term'>action</strong>.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of this system, <span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> can provide real-time character description and development.<sup class='sidenote-marker' data='ref-character-development'>&#8251;</sup> <span class='sidenote'><span class='note'><span id='ref-character-development' class='sidenote-marker-ref'>&#8251;</span><span class='quote-context'>Although in-game characterization is rare, I disagree with Jesper Juul when he claims that</span><span class='quote'>Character description and development is either ignored or done in cut-scenes (since this is too hard to implement in game form).</span>- <span class='ref'>Games Telling Stories: A Brief Note on Games and Narratives</span> in <a href='http://www.amazon.com/New-Media-Cybercultures-Anthology/dp/1405183071'>The New Media and Cybercultures Anthology</a></span></span> In the <a class='internal-ref internal-ref-up' href='#story-simulator'>story simulator prototype</a>, characters can engage in the actions</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>murder</strong></li>
            <li><strong>insult</strong></li>
            <li><strong>complain</strong></li>
            <li><strong>flirt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>compliment</strong></li>
            <li><strong>suffer guilt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>plan retribution</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>These actions are highly contextual. For example, in the <a class='internal-ref internal-ref-up' href='#story-simulator'>prototype</a>, character A will only murder character B if they are both alive, there are no other individuals in the room, and they are enemies.</p>
          <p><img src='images/Anger.png' /><img src='images/Murder.png' /></p>
          <p>One of the biggest challenges in creating <span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> will be balancing the need to make the actions complex enough to create compelling stories and simple/obvious enough for players to predict.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='subsection'>
          <h3 id='wordless-stories'>Wordless Stories</h3>
          <p>When we think of stories, we usually think of explicit narratives. In novels, they are conveyed purely through words. In films, narratives are traditionally expressed through a combination of moving images, music, and verbal dialog.</p>
          <p>However, words are not essential to storytelling. Consider the short story <span class='ref'>Luxo Jr.</span> created by Pixar:</p>
          <p><iframe class='inline-video' height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Hrnz2pg3YPg?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
          <p>It conveys a simple narrative without any spoken dialog; the images and sounds tell the story.</p>
          <p>Interpretive dance is a medium that is dedicated to conveying narrative without words. Wordless tales can be just as powerful as stories that use elegant language. Language agnostic narratives provide the additional benefit of being more universal between cultures.</p>
          <p>One of the early inspirations for <span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span> was <a class='ref' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_No_More_(2011_play)'>Punchdrunk's Sleep No More</a>, a post-modern theatrical performance featuring interpretive dance and a repeating story that invited the audience to explore it from different perspectives.</p>
          <p>Computers are notoriously bad at forming compelling sentences. Well-written dialog requires significant pre-game development work by writers and almost inevitably leads to strictly or largely linear stories. Games with dynamic stories like <a class='ref' href="http://quicksilverinfinitestory.wordpress.com/">Quicksilver: Infinite Story</a> usually need even more content than linear games do because they need to combine lists of situations and entities in order to generate satisfactory dialog.</p>
          <p><span class='ref game-name'>Time Mansion</span>'s stories will largely avoid this content problem; the stories will be told using simple body language and iconic imagery. The main content challenge in the game will be the database of contextual actions required by the <a class='internal-ref internal-ref-up' href='#storytelling-and-ai'>story simulator</a>.</p>
