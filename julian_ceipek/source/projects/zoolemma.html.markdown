**Zoolemma!** is a prototype for a purely strategic 2-3 player boardgame with two unique properties:

- you can move your opponents' pieces as well as your own
- you all plan each move simultaneously to minimize player inaction

Every time a piece moves on the board, the space upon which it lands determines how a different player's piece moves. This mechanic leads to some very interesting meta strategies as players try to predict where their pieces will be during their turns and try to manipulate other players into helping them win.
