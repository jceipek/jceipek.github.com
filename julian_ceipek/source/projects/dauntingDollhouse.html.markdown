**Daunting Dollhouse** is a rapid asymmetric two-player battle of wits and observation that pits a ghost against a ghost hunter. It arose from an interesting design constraint: what if players share a single screen that gives them each different _hidden_ information?

The players each secretly control one of six funky dolls and try to conceal their identities by pretending to be computer-controlled characters. The ghost can switch between the bodies of different dolls while the hunter attempts to catch the ghost by listening for paranormal activity.

The game is currently on hiatus in light of some design flaws that we'll be explaining in depth soon.

In the meantime, here's an early look at the gameplay:
