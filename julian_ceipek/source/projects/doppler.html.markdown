Learning science from a textbook is usually pretty boring. In 2010, [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/) hosted a competition to solicit science explanations that high school students would actually enjoy.

During my first year at [Olin College of Engineering](http://olin.edu/), I created and led a small team to make _The Doppler Effect_, a fun educational video that explains why the sounds cars make on a highway change pitch as they pass by. [We became the winners of the Ars Science Video Contest, Physical Sciences Division](http://arstechnica.com/science/2011/02/ars-announces-the-science-video-contest-winners/#myExperience739279287001).

Since then, it's been used in several high school classes.
