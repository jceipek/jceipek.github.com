In 2011, I took an introductory software design class at [Olin](http://olin.edu/), where I first learned Python and how to collaborate on non-trivial programming projects.

My team's final project was _Complete Galactic Dominion_ (_CGD_), an (over)ambitious real-time strategy game played on a toroidal map (the playing area doesn't have defined boundaries but wraps around like old arcade games like Pac-Man).

By the time the class ended, _CGD_ had one working resource, building, and unit type and
theoretical support for an arbitrary number of networked players playing on different operating systems.
