<h2>Making Faster Systems</h2>
<span class=project-tagline>programming</span>
<span class=project-roles></span>
<div class=project-about><p>This post is based on an in-person presentation I gave earlier this year to an audience of software, mechanical, and electrical engineers. Its examples are software-related, but the principles should apply across domains.</p>
<p>In <em>Structured Programming with <code>go to</code> Statements</em>, Donald E. Knuth wrote &ldquo;&mldr;premature optimization is the root of all evil&rdquo;, and people have been misquoting him ever since. They tend to miss both what he meant by &ldquo;premature&rdquo; and what has changed since he wrote those words in 1974.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll get back to that. First, let&rsquo;s consider <em>why</em> we might want to make faster systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>it leads to happier customers &ndash; people generally don&rsquo;t like waiting for things, and fast systems lead to fast feedback loops</li>
<li>it leads to happier companies &ndash; happier customers ideally lead to higher profits. In the case of client-server software, companies pay for the resources they use, and faster systems tend to use fewer resources. Which company <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> want to decrease their cloud spend?</li>
<li>it leads to a happier planet &ndash; reducing resource consumption reduces environmental impact</li>
<li>it leads to a happier <em>you</em>, because making systems faster is fun and rewarding</li>
</ol>
<p>If we want to make faster systems, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand the Problem</strong></li>
<li><strong>Only Do Useful Work</strong></li>
<li><strong>Measure</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id=understand-the-problem>Understand the Problem</h2>
<p>At their simplest, we can think of systems as transforming inputs into outputs. Two systems with the same inputs and outputs can have vastly different performance characteristics.
We all know that nothing is faster than light. That is also true of software systems, which operate on physical computers, as much as marketing terms like &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; would have you think otherwise.
Every computer has one or more CPUs (central processing units) that process inputs into outputs. To make faster software systems, we have to understand how fast the computers that execute them are.
Computers are really fast. For example, adding two numbers together might take 0.33 nanoseconds. To put that in perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>1000 nanoseconds = 1 microsecond</li>
<li>1000 microseconds = 1 millisecond</li>
<li>1000 milliseconds = 1 second</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a computer can perform 3,000,000,000 (3 billion) additions per lane per core per second.</p>
<p>If you open up a computer, take out the CPU, dunk it in a vat of hydrochloric acid, and look at it under a microscope, you&rsquo;ll see something similar to this:</p>
<p><img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/die_shot.png alt></p>
<p>This chip has 4 cores:
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/die_shot_cores.png alt></p>
<p>The parts of each core that perform addition are the execution units. <img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/die_shot_journey.png alt>If the execution units already have the numbers to add loaded, addition can be really fast. If they don&rsquo;t, they have to fetch them from the L1 data cache. If the L1 cache doesn&rsquo;t have the numbers, they have to fetch them from the L2 cache. If the L2 cache doesn&rsquo;t have the numbers, they have to fetch them from the L3 cache, which, on this chip, is shared across all 4 cores. If the L3 cache doesn&rsquo;t have the data, they have to fetch them from main memory. Each of these involves a longer and longer physical distance, and the data has to physically travel to where it is needed. Remember that nothing is faster than light.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put these distances into perspective. Here I&rsquo;ve slowed down the operations by a factor of 1 billion so that 1 nanosecond takes 1 second of real time.</p>

<p>The specific times here don&rsquo;t really matter and come from a computer I don&rsquo;t have anymore. What matters is that they span multiple orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>In <em>Structured Programming with <code>go to</code> Statements</em>, Knuth wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In established engineering disciplines a 12% improvement, easily obtained, is never considered marginal; and I believe the same viewpoint should prevail in software engineering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think he would say about a 10,000+% improvement (having the numbers in the L1 cache vs fetching them from memory)?</p>
<p>He was writing in 1974, when memory and processor speed were about the same. Since then, the gap between processor and memory speed has grown many orders of magnitude apart, and we can&rsquo;t ignore that if we want to create fast software.
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/processor_memory_gap.png alt>
(chart from <a href=https://archive.org/details/computerarchitectureaquantitativeapproach6thedition/page/n111/mode/1up>Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, 6th Edition, page 80</a>)</p>
<p>In 1974, Knuth&rsquo;s programs executed almost directly on the CPU. A typical web application today has many more layers between its code and the CPU, including an operating system (30 million lines of code), a browser (26 million lines of code) with a virtual machine, and likely 10s-100s of 3rd party libraries. On many software projects, developers can only really control what 3rd party libraries they use and what code they write themselves, and have to understand the constraints imposed by the operating system, browser, and virtual machine.</p>
<h2 id=only-do-useful-work>Only Do Useful Work</h2>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve understood the problem, we can use our understanding to minimize waste. The fastest thing is doing nothing. The fastest <em>useful</em> thing is doing nothing unneeded.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, I&rsquo;ll use a case study from a web project where I needed to find the brightest and darkest pixels in a user-specified region of an image. The inputs were the compressed image in main memory and the coordinates of the region. The desired outputs were the brightest and darkest pixel of the image.</p>
<p>When faced with a problem like this, I like to think about the simplest way of getting from the inputs to the outputs. This might not be the fastest way, but simple code with few dependencies is the easiest code to change.</p>
<p>In this case, the simplest approach I could think of was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decompress the compressed image</li>
<li>Sequentially look at every pixel in the user-specified region, recording the brightest and darkest pixels found so far</li>
</ol>
<p>The code I inherited looked like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decompress the compressed image to main memory</li>
<li>Upload the decompressed image to graphics memory</li>
<li>Download the image from graphics memory</li>
<li>Upload the image to graphics memory</li>
<li>Create a copy of the pixels in the user-specified region</li>
<li>Sort the copied pixels by brightness</li>
<li>Retrieve the brightest and darkest pixels from the sorted copy</li>
</ol>
<p>This code had passed code review. It &ldquo;followed best practices.&rdquo; It was wasteful and hard to change.</p>
<p>After my improvements, it looked like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decompress the compressed image to main memory</li>
<li>Upload the image to graphics memory</li>
<li>Download the image from graphics memory</li>
<li>Sequentially search the pixels in the user-specified region for the brightest and darkest pixels</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not quite the simple strategy I wanted, but this was part of a web application. The browser imposed a constraint that made the decompressed image in main memory inaccessible, so I needed to upload it and download it from graphics memory to get access to the pixels. Nonetheless, my implementation was much faster than the original.</p>
<p>Contrast this with a different strategy: if I had timed the original program, I might have found that the slowest individual part was sorting the pixels. I might have replaced the sorting algorithm with a faster, &ldquo;optimized&rdquo; algorithm for this application. That would have been a mistake, because sorting wasn&rsquo;t necessary. <em>Nothing</em> is faster than light.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to Knuth&rsquo;s &ldquo;&mldr;premature optimization is the root of all evil.&rdquo; My approach wasn&rsquo;t <em>premature</em>. It involved understanding the problem and trying to only do useful work.</p>
<h2 id=measure>Measure</h2>
<p>Professional optimizers compare:</p>
<ol>
<li>How fast could it go?</li>
<li>How fast does it go?
and then repeatedly measure and make changes until the actual speed approaches the estimated optimal theoretical speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>When determining these values, it&rsquo;s important to differentiate <em>latency</em> (how long it takes to do something) from <em>throughput</em> (how many of those things you can do in a given timeframe). If a laundromat has 3 washing machines that each take 1 hour to wash a load of laundry, it will take no less than 1 hour to wash 1 load of laundry. The latency is 1 hour. Adding washing machines won&rsquo;t make it go faster, but a faster washing machine would. However, with 3 machines, you can wash up to 3 loads of laundry at the same time. The throughput is 3 loads/hour.</p>
<p>For the rest of this section, I&rsquo;ll use latency measurements from the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of a robotic display case I programmed in 2018. Among other things, the brain was responsible for deciding the colors of 1189 individual LEDs, 30 times per second (once every 33 milliseconds) using a slow $35 computer. Determining the colors was the slowest part of the program (over 100 milliseconds), and I needed to make it much faster. How did I know to focus on this part of the program? I used profiling tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is often a mistake to make a priori judgements about what parts of a program are really critical, since the universal experience of programmers who have been using measurement tools has been that their intuitive guesses fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash; Knuth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profiling tools often produce icicle graphs &ndash; visualizations that show how long different parts of a process take using labeled rectangles arranged such that substeps are lower down than the steps that depend on them. In this icicle graph (produced using <a href=https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer>viztracer</a> and <a href=https://gravitymoth.com/spall/spall-web.html>Spall</a> on my fast 2019 laptop), we can see that <code>animationStep</code> is a substep of <code>animationTick</code>, which is itself a substep of <code>_run</code>. The yellow rectangles labeled <code>animationStep</code> are wide, which suggests that the program is spending a lot of time in <code>animationStep</code> (around 50 milliseconds with profiler overhead).
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/animation_step_icicle_profile.png alt></p>
<p>When I first started practicing optimization, my approach was to measure the latency of an existing system, make some changes, measure again, and discard the changes if the newer measurement was slower. I notice many other people do this as well. This is a mistake.</p>
<p>If I measure three different implementations of <code>animationTick</code> once, I might get the following latencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A (the implementation above, without profiler overhead): 20.9 milliseconds</li>
<li>B: 0.58 milliseconds</li>
<li>C: 1.97 milliseconds</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like B is faster than C is much faster than A. But plotting thousands of runs for each implementation tells a different story:
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/scatterplots_abc.png alt><img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/scatterplot_bc.png alt></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough overlap between B and C that using a single measurement isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>Another common thing people do is compute average measurements. Averages obscure distributions, and in most applications, latency outliers matter. After an update, my favorite podcast app sometimes took up to 3 seconds to respond when I tapped the play/pause button. I no longer use that app.</p>
<p>Here, the B average of 1.21 milliseconds completely hides the latency outlier at 3.59 milliseconds:
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/scatterplot_bc_average.png alt>
The median is not totally useless. While it still hides outliers, it tells us the latency that 50% of runs were faster (and slower) than:
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/scatterplot_bc_median_average.png alt>
But what we&rsquo;re really interested in is more than we can capture in a single number (or even a few numbers). We want to understand the <em>latency distribution</em>. This is where we might be tempted to reach for histograms:
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/histograms_bc.png alt>
Unfortunately, histograms require picking a size for each bin, and bins don&rsquo;t really make sense for continuous time measurements. Histograms are perfect if we want to be able to say things like &ldquo;461 of the runs with implementation B took between 1.28 and 1.29 milliseconds.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know about you, but that&rsquo;s not the kind of thing I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to know.
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/histograms_labeled_bar_bc.png alt>
They also make it hard to answer the common questions we <em>are</em> interested in, like &ldquo;what percent of the runs with implementation B were faster than 1.2 milliseconds?&rdquo;
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/histograms_bc_highlighted_region.png alt></p>
<p>To answer that question, we would have to add up the heights of all the bars we&rsquo;re interested in and divide by the total number of bars, which is really annoying to do by hand. Instead, we can use my favorite type of graph for latency distributions, Cumulative Distribution Functions. To produce a CDF, take an unbinned histogram and divide each bar height by the total number of bars to produce a Probability Density Function (PDF). Then plot the cumulative sum of the PDF. The result is a graph that shows all the same peaks and valleys that a histogram would:
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/cdf_vs_histogram_bc.png alt>
More importantly, the (X, Y) coordinate tells you that Y fraction of samples were faster than X time. For example, here&rsquo;s the answer to our question from before:
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/cdf_vs_histogram_labeled_bc.png alt>
This is commonly written as pY for any value of Y. For example, the median is p50, the 50th percentile. If the p90 is 1.42 milliseconds, that means 90% of measurements were faster (and 10% slower) than 1.42 milliseconds.
<img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/cdf_p90_p50_bc.png alt></p>
<p>I personally prefer to use the CCDF instead, which flips the y axis upside down. &ldquo;I only need to make this faster in 20% of cases&rdquo; makes me feel better than &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 80% of the way there.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s up to you. Just make sure to label your axes so everyone knows what kind of graph it is.</p>
<p><img src=/projects/makingfastersystems/ccdf_bc.png alt></p>
<p>Context always matters when interpreting data, and percentiles are no different. If an operation happens 1000 times during a typical user session, we can expect the p99 latency for that operation to happen around 10 times (<code>1000 * (1 - 0.99) = 10</code>) per session.

<p>To make faster systems, start by <strong>Understanding the Problem</strong>. Identify the system inputs and outputs, and think about the hard constraints imposed by physics and the soft constraints imposed by your choices. Does it <em>really</em> make sense to build a microservice?</p>
<p>Then, <strong>Only Do Useful Work</strong>. Instead of complicated approaches, prefer simple solutions that are easy to understand, change, and optimize. Don&rsquo;t skip over understanding by &ldquo;optimizing&rdquo; part of the system that didn&rsquo;t need to exist in the first place. This step is not optional; it is where the biggest improvements come from.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Measure</strong>. True optimization involves iteratively comparing how fast a system is to how fast it should be, and making changes until you&rsquo;re satisfied. Use profiling tools to identify the slow parts of the system and plot all the data to understand whether you&rsquo;re actually making improvements. CDFs and CCDFs are great tools for this. Use the problem context to understand if the system is fast enough. Events that sound rare when summarized with percentiles might happen frequently in practice.</p>
<p>In 1974, Knuth wrote &ldquo;&mldr;premature optimization is the root of all evil.&rdquo; Computing has changed since 1974, and many people don&rsquo;t understand what he meant by &ldquo;premature&rdquo;. Maybe it&rsquo;s time for a new phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignoring reality is the root of all evil.</p>
