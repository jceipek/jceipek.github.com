Its examples are software-related, but the principles apply across domains.
In Structured Programming with go to Statements, Donald E. Knuth wrote &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;premature optimization is the root of all evil&amp;rdquo;, and people have been misquoting him ever since. They tend to miss both what he meant by &amp;ldquo;premature&amp;rdquo; and what has changed since he wrote those words in 1974.</description></item><item><title>The Doppler Effect</title><link>//jceipek.com/projects/doppler.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//jceipek.com/projects/doppler.html</guid><description>Learning science from a textbook is usually pretty boring. In 2010, Ars Technica hosted a competition to solicit science explanations that high school students would actually enjoy.
During my first year at Olin College of Engineering, I created and led a small team to make The Doppler Effect, a fun educational video that explains why the sounds cars make on a highway change pitch as they pass by. We became the winners of the Ars Science Video Contest, Physical Sciences Division.</description></item></channel></rss>
