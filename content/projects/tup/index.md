I'm currently the lead developer of the matchmaking server, administrator portal, and actor management interface of an ambitious immersive multiplayer live theater experience backed by Oculus and created by Tender Claws.

My past roles on the project include

- leading the development of a specialized non-linear sequence editor for interactive narratives with motion capture
- creating a production-ready user interface for improv actors to manipulate shared virtual environments
- building tools for writers to visualize screenplays as 3d animatics
- architecting the player input system
