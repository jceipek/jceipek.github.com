[Iridescence](https://behnazfarahi.com/Iridescence/) is a 3D-printed emotive collar commissioned by the [Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago](https://www.msichicago.org/explore/whats-here/exhibits/wired-to-wear/the-exhibit/partners/garments/) and designed by Behnaz Farahi. It features 200 rotating quills driven by fully custom electromagnetic actuators, and animates in response to the facial expressions and positions of observers (determined via a privacy-preserving facial tracking camera).

I created the software that successfully controlled the wearable for a 15 month exhibition without external intervention. While working on the project, I...

- designed and implemented a hierarchical state machine to drive the wearable's behavior
- created tools for rapidly iterating on procedural animations
- worked closely with Behnaz to design animations for the wearable
