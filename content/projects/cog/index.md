Behnaz Farahi's [Caress of the Gaze](https://behnazfarahi.com/caress-of-the-gaze/) is a dress that changes shape when people look at it, exploring social issues such as intimacy, gender and personal identity.
It has been featured by outlets including [Wired](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/3-d-printed-garment-shape-shifts-based-on-an-onlookers-gaze/), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/caress-of-the-gaze-wearable-tech/index.html), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/08/clothing-that-reacts-to-your-gaze), [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-36905314), [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-up-here-michael-up-here.html), and [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/culture/the-fashion-item-that-reacts-when-someone-looks-at-it/).

I developed the control software for the final iteration of the dress. Along the way, I...
- created a reusable C library to communicate with a privacy-preserving face tracking camera, which I've since used on many other projects
- worked closely with Behnaz to design reactive procedural animations driven by gaze-tracking data
- learned how to control shape memory alloy actuators that expand and contract like muscles
