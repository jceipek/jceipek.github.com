[Returning the Gaze](https://behnazfarahi.com/returning-the-gaze/) is a robotics installation by Behnaz Farahi, supported by Universal Robots, and commissioned by fashion label ANNAKIKI for its cyborg-themed Milan Fashion Week 2022.

I worked closely with Behnaz to develop the high concept of the project: a fashion model cybernetically enhanced rather than controlled by technology stares back at an audience primed to be the watchers at a fashion show. We prototyped many different design directions before creating what [Georgina McWhirter of _Interior Design_](https://interiordesign.net/designwire/behnaz-farahis-return-the-gaze-performance-piece-showcases-her-responsive-materials/) calls

> a clever investigation of the fashion industryâ€™s history of complicity with objectification.

My technical roles on the project included...
- learning the proprietary Universal Robots programming language, URScript
- designing and implementing safe multithreaded robot control code and a system to drive and synchronize the behavior of four robotic arms moving fluidly in close proximity to a human performer
- creating tools to help Behnaz record, simplify, and compose robot animations using a 6-DOF VR controller
