[Tendar](https://tenderclaws.com/tendar) is an award-winning augmented reality game critique of machine learning in the guise of a pet simulation narrative game. It was backed by Google, created by Tender Claws, and featured at Sundance New Frontiers 2018.

I created early game prototypes, developed the game's overall architecture, and implemented core gameplay systems. I also...
- developed and integrated native Android plugins to identify real world objects, faces, and emotions from live camera feeds
- worked with contacts at Google to refine prerelease AR technologies
- helped create procedural animations for the game's central character
- created in-house tools to accelerate artist, writer, and game designer workflows
