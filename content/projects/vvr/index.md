[Virtual Virtual Reality](https://tenderclaws.com/vvr) is an award-winning VR game with 50k+ installs and majority 5-star ratings. I helped develop the game's prize-winning first prototype during a game jam. While I was in grad school, Tender Claws turned it into a full game for Google's Daydream VR headset with backing from Google. After I graduated, I joined Tender Claws full-time and rearchitected the game to support different VR/desktop/console platforms and control schemes.
