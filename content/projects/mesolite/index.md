In under 130 hours, I prototyped, architected, and developed the control software for [Mesolite](http://behnazfarahi.com/mesolite/), an emotive display case commissioned by Adidas and designed by Behnaz Farahi. I used tricks from game development to reduce iteration bottlenecks and improve performance 20x.

Along the way, I...

- learned how to use a Raspberry Pi and used it to create a wifi-enabled realtime monitoring and simulation interface
- learned about servo motors and built a 30-second calibration tool using the dials on a MIDI controller
- empowered a procedural animator, Mitch Mastroni, to orchestrate the individual and collective behavior of over a thousand color-changing lights in realtime based on the positions and facial expressions of nearby observers
- designed protocols to coordinate communication between four microcontrollers and a Raspberry Pi
