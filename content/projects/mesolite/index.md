I prototyped, architected, and developed the control software for an emotive display case commissioned by Adidas and designed by Behnaz Farahi. I used tricks from game development to reduce iteration bottlenecks and improve performance 20x.

Along the way, I

- learned how to use a Raspberry Pi and used it to create a wifi-enabled realtime monitoring and simulation interface
- learned about servo motors and built a rapid calibration tool using the dials on a MIDI controller
- empowered an animator to orchestrate the individual and collective behavior of over a thousand color-changing lights in realtime
