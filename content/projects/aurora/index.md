[Aurora](https://behnazfarahi.com/aurora/) is an interactive kinetic ceiling that changes its configuration in response to what is happening in the space beneath it.

I developed software to simulate the ceiling virtually while also driving the motors that control it physically. I worked closely with Behnaz Farahi to design depth camera-driven procedural animations for the ceiling.
