**Tetheron** is a frantic 2-6 player competitive arcade game in which you swing around a destructible physics environment by tethering onto obstacles and other players. We're developing the game as part of Richard Lemarchand's Experimental Games class at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media and Games graduate program and hope to release it soon.
