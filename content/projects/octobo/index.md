[Octobo](https://web.archive.org/web/20221025223914/https://thinker-tinker.com/) is a plush soft robot that helps children from 0-7 years old learn the alphabet, spelling, rhythm, and the foundations of STEM education.

Yuting Su designed Octobo at USC. As the sole developer on her thesis project team, I...
- created the microcontroller software, BLE-based communication protocol, and iPad app that allow the toy to interact with children
- worked with Yuting to evaluate microcontrollers and sensors for the toy's prototype
- showcased the toy at events
- helped Yuting in discussions with potential manufacturers
