I created **effect** as a 2 week experiment in large scale, local multi-person, multi-display interactions. Thirteen participants connected to a web app displaying a simple pipe puzzle and needed to collaborate in order to guide a ball through a maze. Each participant could rotate a single randomly assigned pipe in the puzzle by clicking on their screen, but they were not given any additional feedback. One additional computer projected a special version of the puzzle on a large projection screen.

During a test session lasting around thirty minutes, players self-organized to identify the pipes under their control, elected a leader to specify a valid route, and collectively voted to complete a simulated hacking attempt on the computer hosting the large-scale projection.
